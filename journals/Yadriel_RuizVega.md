Development Timeline
Week 1:
Began the project by setting up the backend infrastructure using FastAPI. Implemented user signup functionality, allowing users to register with details such as picture URL, gender, first and last name, and description. Additionally, initiated the development of user preferences and their linkage upon signup.

Week 2:
Continued backend development by completing the implementation of user preferences and enabling filtering based on these preferences. Implemented functionality for users to send likes and accept likes, paving the way for the creation of matches in the database.

Week 3:
Transitioned to frontend development, contributing to the JSX for swiping functionality. Delved into learning TypeScript to ensure proper integration with React. Explored React Spring for animation, practicing its usage to enhance the swiping experience on the application's cards.

Week 4:
Completed the frontend implementation of swiping functionality, allowing users to send likes while incorporating animations using React Spring. Successfully linked the frontend to the FastAPI backend, enabling seamless communication for sending likes and managing card interactions. Employed custom CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the application interface.

Next Steps
Refinement: Continuously refine both backend and frontend components to improve performance, user experience, and visual aesthetics.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any bugs or issues across different devices and browsers.
Additional Features: Explore the integration of additional features such as messaging, user matching algorithms, and social media integration to enhance the overall functionality of the application.
Deployment: Prepare the application for deployment, considering scalability, security, and deployment environment requirements.
