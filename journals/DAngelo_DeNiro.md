10MAY2024:
Project finalization.


09MAY2024:
Completed assigned unit test. Was very difficult however I understand it now.


08MAY2024:
Restfulized preferences endpoint, fixed DOM properties error on SignIn Page.


07MAY2024:
I finished the cards for the GetAllLikes page however the buttons are not functional, nor connected to any kind of EventListener.


06MAY2024:
I was able to create hooks for the GetAllLikes component for fetching the users, and likes as opposed to using fetches. These hooks will be able to used elsewhere in the application. I also started and finished Matches.jsx which gets all the users, and all the likes, filters the likes to return only the people who have liked our logged in users to display them on the screen for our user.


02MAY2024:
The authentication issue was solved with the simple line: 
"credentials: 'include'" 
I was thus able to finish the functionality of the GetAllLikes page. I tested the page by creating two different users, ensuring that they had no likes, then had one of the users 'like' the other, logged in as the 'liked' user and saw the like from the 'liking' user displayed on the page.


01MAY2024:
Began development of the 'GetAllLikes' component which will display all of the the users who have 'liked' our logged in user, however considering the sign in page isn't functioning, I am unable to test whether the GetAllLikes component is actually working. It keeps returning a 401. Began tinkering with the Sign In form. I am now able to Sign In however I don't stay signed in when navigating to the likes page.


30APR2024:
Removed preferences column in users table in conjunction with worked on the SignUp page. Attempted to get a 'range slider' on the SignUp page for the user's age preferences. The decision was made to have a seperate page for the romantic preferences due to the romantic_pref table having a userID that owns that row in the table. This assumes that the user is already created. Pending issue: the actual preference not being linked to the user on the backend.


29APR2024:
Further mob programming for the front end. Planned design ideas to be implemented. 


26APR2024:
Ensured that the routes followed restful conventions. Mob programmed for frontend, specifically Signup page.


25APR2024:
We spoke to Riley again, he commented that our routes aren't restful. Revisited the learn cards for a refresher on restful conventions. Further planning was conducted on how exactly the backend will tie into the frontend.


24APR2024:
Further matches table editing and planning for the backend.


23APR2024:
Loaded male, female, non-binary default genders into genders table to be created whenever the database is loaded in conjunction with creating an instance of a user for each of the genders to be loaded as well.


22APR2024:
Created a likes table which required lotss of changes, recreated matches table, fixed romantic_pref table to include user1_id as a ForeignKey to the users table, completed documentation for gender, romantic_pref, and likes tables, created a likes function, started but not finished the get_all_likes function. Further edited the likes table.


18APR2024:
Restructured database in accordance with Riley's design advice.


17APR2024:
Completed Signup, Signin, Authenticate, and Signout as well as Get All users.


16APR2024:
Peer coded models and migrations in conjunction with gender repository being created for fastapi.


15APR2024:
Planned most of how our database tables are going to be made as well as creating the users, matches, interests, romantic_pref, and gender tables. Finished create_user route, and solved incompatible database migration issue.
