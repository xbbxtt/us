Today we worked on the User Model and polishing and finishing the relationships with other DBs.
We also added a new feature to our wireframe to support a "View Your Likes!" Feature

Today we sorted out the sign up and sign in method as well as sign out. We also found a way to filter users by their Gender and are planning on adding
the Likes methods tomorrow.

Today we worked on getting the Likes function to work. The way it's set up is as a user sends a like, their id will be stored into a likes array
that the liked user will see. Once the liked user returns a like, both ids of the users will be moved to a matches array for each resepctive user

We fixed our Databases and added a likes feature to our Wireframe where the user can see the likes they have received and then choose to accept or decline.
We are catching up on our documentation as well today.

We changed all of our components to have hooks through redux, cleared up ubiquitous language with the likes. The logged_in_user will always be the one who sees the like, the liked_by_user will always be the person who sends the like whether or not they are logged in or not.
